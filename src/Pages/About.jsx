              Kukur Tihar, a cherished day in Nepalâ€™s Tihar festival, is dedicated
              to honoring dogs for their loyalty, companionship, and spiritual role.
              Dogs are revered as the messengers of Yama, the god of death, and are
              adorned with garlands, a tika on their foreheads, and given special
              meals.
